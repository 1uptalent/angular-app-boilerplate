# A Lineman JS boilerplater


This is a project template for Angular JS applications using [Lineman](http://www.linemanjs.com) and [Lineman JS Template using Angular](https://github.com/linemanjs/lineman-angular-template).

It includes the following features:

1. Template Precompilation into Angulars $templateCache using `grunt-angular-templates`
2. A basic login, logout service bound to sample routes inside `config/server.coffee`
3. A router, and 2 views `home` and `login`
4. A directive that shows a message on mouseover
5. 2 Controllers, for `home` and `login`, with $scope variables set and bound
6. A working, bound login form (username/password don't matter, but are required)
7. Configured [grunt-ngmin](https://github.com/btford/grunt-ngmin) so you don't have to fully qualify angular dependencies.
8. Auto generated [sourcemaps](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/) with inlined sources via [grunt-concat-sourcemap](https://github.com/kozy4324/grunt-concat-sourcemap) (you'll need to [enable sourcemaps](http://cl.ly/image/1d0X2z2u1E3b) in Firefox/Chrome to see this)
9. [Unit Tests](https://github.com/davemo/lineman-angular-template/tree/master/spec) and [End-to-End Tests](https://github.com/davemo/lineman-angular-template/tree/master/spec-e2e)
10. Configuration to run [Protractor](https://github.com/juliemr/protractor) for End-to-End Tests

# Instructions

1. `git clone https://github.com/1uptalent/angular-app-boilerplate.git my-angular-app`
2. `cd my-angular-app`
3. `npm install -g lineman`
4. `npm install -g bower`
5. `npm install`
6. `lineman run`
7. open your web browser to localhost:3001

# Running Tests

This template was used as the basis of [@davemo](http://www.github.com/davemo)'s [Testing Strategies for Angular JS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYVcY9EJcRs) screencast, and contains all the tests we wrote in the screencast and a few more!

To run the unit tests:

1. `lineman run` from 1 terminal window
2. `lineman spec` from another terminal window, this will launch Testem and execute specs in Chrome

To run the end-to-end tests:

1. `npm install protractor`
2. `brew install selenium-server-standalone`
3. `brew install chromedriver`
3. Make sure you have chrome installed.
4. `lineman run` from 1 terminal window
5. `lineman grunt spec-e2e` from another terminal window

  Troubleshooting:

    If you see this error: Warning: there's no selenium server jar at the specified location,
    you may need to change the selenium-server-standalone jar version in config/spec-e2e.coffee
    to the actual you see in /usr/local/opt/selenium-server-standalone/libexec.

    If you see this error: Fatal error: The path to the driver executable must be set by the
    webdriver.chrome.driver system property, you may need to download the chromedriver
    (https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver) and place it in /usr/local/bin (mac).

Hopefully this helps you get up and running with AngularJS!
